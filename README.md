# Recite

Recite is a FREE and open source API that contains amazing quotes from books (fiction/non-fiction).

## Why I created this API?

I wanted to use quotes from books in my Next.js project just like how Goodreads has so many quotes. But I couldn't find a good API for this. There are various APIs that give famous quotes said by authors or important people but that wasn't satisfying my use case. Hence, I created an API of my own.
